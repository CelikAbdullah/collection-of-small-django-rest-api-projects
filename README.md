# A Collection of Small Django Rest Api Projects

A collection of small Django Rest Api Projects.

Current Projects: 

| Project Name | Description|
|--------------| -----------| 
| [ItemsRestApi](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/collection-of-small-django-rest-api-projects/tree/main/ItemsRestApi) | In this project, the user can create, retrieve, update, delete or search for Items. An Item is a model which has only one attribute 'name'. I created this to play a little bit with the Paging library of Android for which I also created a project you can find [here](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/collection-of-small-android-app-projects/tree/main/PagingWithNetworkAndDatabase).|
