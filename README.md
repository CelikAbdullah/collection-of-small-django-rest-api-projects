# A Collection of Small Django Rest Api Projects

A collection of small Django Rest Api Projects.

Current Projects: 

| Project Name | Description|
|--------------| -----------| 
| [ItemsRestApi](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/collection-of-small-django-rest-api-projects/tree/main/ItemsRestApi) | In this project, the user can create, retrieve, update, delete or search for Items. An Item is a model which has only one attribute 'name'. I created this to play a little bit with the Paging library of Android for which I also created a project you can find [here](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/collection-of-small-android-app-projects/tree/main/PagingWithNetworkAndDatabase).|
| [AuthenticationRestApi](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/collection-of-small-django-rest-api-projects/tree/main/AuthenticationRestApi) | In this project, we can register a User, login a User and change the password of a User. For this project, I used '[Django-Rest-Knox](https://james1345.github.io/django-rest-knox/installation/)' as 3rd party library. If you are familiar with Android App development, I have also created a little Android App as frontend that is talking to this REST API project. You can find it [here](https://github.com/CelikAbdullah/collection-of-small-android-app-projects/tree/main/Authentication) |
